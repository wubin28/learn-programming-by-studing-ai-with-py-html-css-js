# Me:

> 1. The business requirement mentions
 "bias
   detection" but the actual column is
  "bias_detection_score" (a continuous
  score). Should I interpret higher 
scores
  as better fairness performance?
A: Yes, please.


  2. For Questions 1 and 2, when 
calculating
   percentages, should I calculate the
  percentage of multimodal-capable 
agents
  WITHIN each 
agent_type/model_architecture,
   or as a percentage of ALL agents?
A: Please calculate the
  percentage of multimodal-capable 
agents
  WITHIN each 
agent_type/model_architecture.

  Thank you for the clarifications!
  Now I understand:
  1. Higher bias_detection_score =
  better fairness
  2. Calculate percentage WITHIN each
  agent_type/model_architecture

  Let me create Python code to answer
  the 3 business questions:

  out of 5 agents)
  2. Document Processor - 33.33% (2
  out of 6 agents)
  3. Sales Assistant - 28.57% (2 out
  of 7 agents)

  Question 2: Top 3 Model 
  Architectures with Highest

  agents)
  2. CodeT5+ - 33.33% (3 out of 9
  agents)
  3. Transformer-XL - 20.00% (2 out of
   10 agents)

  Question 3: Top 3 Task Categories 
  with Highest Median Bias Detection 
  Score

  Answer:
  1. Communication - Median score:
  0.821 (5 agents)
  2. Research & Summarization - Median
   score: 0.785 (4 agents)
  3. Decision Making - Median score:
  0.782 (5 agents)

  Key Observations:

  - Total of 80 data records analyzed
  (matching requirements)
  - Only 12 out of 80 agents (15%)
  support multimodal capabilities
  - Bias detection scores range from
  ~0.69 to ~0.83 across task
  categories
  - Research Assistant has the highest
   multimodal adoption rate
  - Communication tasks show the best
  fairness performance
